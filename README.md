Jimmy Flitz Anziehspiel
=======================

In this mobile app, youngsters can learn to put on the right clothes for the season with Jimmy before going out to explore the world. Four seasons to choose from and a weather surprise. For each a closet with a selection of clothes and accessories with which to dress-up the mouse from tip to toe. Kids will experiment to find the right combination that gets Jimmy Flitz out the door singing and dancing to the music.

The full game code developed for Appcelerator Titanium 1 has been optimized for iPhone builds and is now open source. We're hoping to open up the art assets too in the next few weeks.
